#####Advanced Features
This scene includes advanced features such as reflections. With the plane mirror the magnification of the 
image is 1. In the right mirror (concave) when the image is in front of the focal point the image is inverted and 
becomes larger the closer it gets to the focal point and becomes right side up when it passes the focal point. For the 
left mirror (convex) the image is always upright, reduced and virtual. 

Another feature in this scene is shadows. The avatar's shadow becomes elongated as the object moves further from the 
light source and larger as the object gets closer to the light source.
