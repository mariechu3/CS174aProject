#####Advanced Features
This scene includes advanced features such as reflections. With the plane mirror the magnification of the 
image is 1. In the right mirror (concave) when the image is in front of the focal point the image is inverted and 
becomes larger the closer it gets to the focal point and becomes right side up when it passes the focal point. For the 
left mirror (convex) the image is always upright, reduced and virtual. 

Another feature in this scene is shadows. The avatar's shadow becomes elongated as the object moves further from the 
light source and larger as the object gets closer to the light source.



####*Darts:*

#####Brief Description
This scene simulates a Dart game in which a user can aim and shoot at a target. It simulates the effect of wind and gravity on the path of the projectile. There is also a descriptor box that keeps track of the score and additional descriptors for the shot such as wind speed, direction, etc. If the user hits a bulls-eye fireworks will go off.

#####Advanced Features
This scene uses collision detection to determine if the dart hit the target and calculates the score according to where on the target the dart hit. 

 ####*Main Scene:*
#####Brief Description
The Main scene navigates between the two scenes and includes the implementation of simple fireworks in the background.
